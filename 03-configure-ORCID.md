## Automating Repetitive Tasks With ORCID

Managing research outputs effectively across different platforms can be challenging for researchers. While ORCID provides a persistent digital identifier for researchers, its full potential comes from its ability to integrate with other scholarly systems. This episode focuses on connecting your ORCID profile with three key systems: CrossRef, DataCite, and Dimensions.

CrossRef's auto-update feature automatically adds your published articles to your ORCID record, DataCite ensures your datasets and other research outputs are properly attributed, and Dimensions provides an additional way to manually add publications to your ORCID record through its 'Add to ORCID' feature. These integrations help create a comprehensive record of your research contributions.

By connecting ORCID with these systems, you can:

* Save time by reducing manual data entry
* Ensure accurate attribution of your work
* Increase the visibility of your research outputs
* Maintain up-to-date records across multiple platforms
* Track your research impact more effectively

Throughout this episode, you'll learn how to set up and manage these integrations, understand their features, and troubleshoot common issues. These integrations will help streamline your research workflow and enhance your digital presence in the scholarly ecosystem.

## Configuring ORCID Integrations

For each integration, write down the steps you would take to enable auto-update feature that automatically updated your ORCID records with new publications. If you have access to these accounts, you can perform the actual steps. These integrations will help you maintain an up-to-date record of your research outputs without manual intervention.

## Connecting ORCID to Crossref

1. Provide your ORCID when submitting a paper to a journal. Most publishing platforms allow to enter your ORCID iD in the submission system.
2. Once the paper gets published, the publisher will register it with Crossref and include your ORCID iD in the metadata
3. Check your ORCID inbox after you publish. You'll receive a notification in your ORCID inbox with the subject “Crossref has made changes to your ORCID record”
4. Authorize Crossref Auto-updates. Once you receive the notification, grant Crossref permission to update your record.
5. Optional. Manually link Crossref to ORCID

## Connecting ORCID to DataCite

Method 1: Through your ORCID record

1. Log in to your ORCID account
2. Navigate to your ORCID record
3. Find the "Works" section
4. Click on "Add"
5. Select "Search & Link"
6. Look for and select the DataCite option
7. Grant permissions to DataCite when prompted

Method 2: Through DataCite 

1. Go to DataCite Profiles (https://profiles.datacite.org/)
2. Sign in with Globus. Select your institution, or sign in with your ORCID.
3. Go to Settings (click on your name to access Settings menu).
4. Click "Get ORCID Token" button (your screen should then refresh and this button will be relabeled as "Delete ORCID Token")
5. Confirm that in the Settings menu that after "Auto-Update" you see the words "is enabled" (if not click on the "Update" button and tick the "Auto-Update is enabled" box)

## Connecting ORCID to Dimensions

1. Go to the Dimensions platform (https://app.dimensions.ai).
2. Log in to your Dimensions account (or create one).
3. Look for an option to connect your ORCID. In your account settings click on “ORCID Information” link.
4. Click on the option to connect your ORCID.

## Populating your ORCID with Dimensions

Dimensions offer a streamlined way to add publications to your ORCID records through its ‘Add to ORCID’ feature. While not automatic like CrossRef’s updated, this manual process gives you control over which publications appear in your ORCID profile. In this exercise, you'll learn how to use Dimensions to search for your publications and add them to your ORCID record using the platform's integration features. Dimensions is particularly effective at identifying conference proceedings publications, making it a valuable tool for researchers who regularly present at conferences. This manual adding feature ensures you can easily find and add conference papers to your ORCID record. 

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## CLAIM YOUR PUBLICATIONS IN DIMENSIONS

1. Search for your publications in Dimensions by either:
    * Entering your name
    * Looking up your profile
    * Searching for specific paper titles
2. Once you find your publications, you can claim them one at a time. Find the 'Add to ORCID' button below each publication. Review the confirmation prompt: "Are you sure you want to add this work to your ORCID record?" and click to confirm. The button status will change to 'In your ORCID record' indicating successful addition.
3. Go to your ORCID record and check your ‘Works’ section. Locate the new publication entry. Verify that "Source: Dimensions" appears with the entry

## ADDING GRANTS WITH ORCID's WIZARD

ORCID's Search and Link wizard can be used to select existing grants and add them to your ORCID record. Here are the steps:

1. Log in to your ORCID account
2. Go to the Funding section
3. Click "Add funding"
4. Select "Search & Link"
5. Choose "Dimensions Wizard"
6. Search by your name to find associated grants, or by Grant Title. An asterisk works as a wildcard character here (e.g., "music therap*" finds "music therapy" and "music therapists").
7. Choose grants from search results and click "Next" and then "Submit to ORCID" button.

## ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS

- How might this auto-update feature save you time in maintaining your ORCID record?
- What is the key difference between how Crossref or DataCite auto-updates work compared to Dimensions' publication adding feature?
- Why might you need both automatic (Crossref or DataCite) and manual (Dimensions) methods for managing your ORCID record?
