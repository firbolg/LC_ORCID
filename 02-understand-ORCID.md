::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Describe author disambiguation and why it matters (makes your work Findable)
- List the range of scholarly outputs you can track (makes your work Accessible)
- Introduce systems where ORCID can be integrated (makes your record Interoperable)
- Understand how ORCID is institution agnostic (makes your record Reusable)

## ORCID as Open Science

When an ORCID record is populated and shared publicly, it becomes a powerful mechanism for structural change in scholarly communication. Benefits to scholars accumulate over the course of their careers, and what initially might look like one more account with the same information as their CV can actually free them from tedious, repetitive tasks. The more an ORCID is understood as a tool for making scholarly online presence robust and persistent, the more valuable it becomes to each scholar. Open science advances as the scholarly community collectively experiences these benefits. 

In this lesson we will look at the major benefits of maximizing an ORCID’s effectiveness, with the purpose of forming concepts to support advocacy and promotion within our institutional communities. 

## Author Disambiguation

As the number of scholars publishing work increases, the problem of telling authors apart from each other becomes more important to solve. When only internal or proprietary systems hold authoritative metadata that is verified by the authors, librarians, or other trusted parties, the value of their work is diminished. Especially as scholars move from institution to institution, and affiliations are listed in a variety of ways, records become harder to track. Databases which aggregate journals may not be able to accurately distinguish among many authors with the same name. Departments may not be able to track their publishing activity. Researchers working in adjacent areas may not find each other to collaborate. Recruiters may not be aware of the full scope of a researcher’s contribution to their field. A scholar may be asked to enter the same information about their published work over and over in different systems, detracting from their focus and taking away cognitive resources that could be assigned to high value tasks.

## RANDOM NAMES, REAL AUTHORS?

1. Use Namey to generate a random name:  https://namey.muffinlabs.com/ 
2. Enter this name into ORCID’s search box:  https://orcid.org/ 
3. Put quotes around the text so that it is read as a string
4. Hit enter. How many results did you get?

Try doing this with your own name, or the name of a colleague. Identical names can appear to be the same person, but ORCID gives researchers a persistent Unique Identifier (UID) that keeps them distinctive in any system that integrates it.

## QUESTIONS:

* Do people at your institution verbally use more than one term or set of terms to refer to their place of employment, their unit or department?
* How many variations of listing your institutional affiliation have you seen? 
* Is there a standard way of listing affiliation at your institution?

## NAME CHANGES

What are some reasons an author might want to edit how their name appears in connection with their publications?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

## SOME SOLUTIONS
 
* Co-authors might submit your name in a way you do not prefer
* Your legal name may change over time
* Branding: a standard name standardizes your scholarly publishing online presence

## Range of Scholarly Products

Different institutions and systems ask for scholarly works to be presented in different formats. The way scholarly works are grouped may differ according to information organization decisions made by an enterprise software provider, or a policy-maker responding to institutional priorities. This discourages diversity in scholarly production because it does not allow exploration or development of emerging formats. It also may overlook established discipline-specific forms of scholarly works. Subscription-based databases, as well as openly accessible databases like PubMedCentral, and webcrawlers like Google Scholar, are all only as complete as the records of scholarly works that have been created, and many systems do not allow the full range of scholarly works to be tracked or recorded. 
While ORCID profiles can minimize time spent on repetitive tasks through automatic updates, it can also be a tool for creating a complete record of scholarly works through manual addition of more uncommon scholarly products. There are more than 40 types of works available to choose when adding a work to an ORCID profile.

#### ORCID Record Scholarly Work Categories:

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## QUESTIONS:

* Are there any categories which are new to you, when conceptualizing what counts as a scholarly product?
* Is there a category you would like to see added?
* Does a work that you have not added to your CV or institutional tracking system match up with an ORCID category? 

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Putting the records of an author’s scholarly products in one place that persists across systems helps make their work accessible. As more systems integrate ORCID, it also streamlines access to the full scope of scholarship that has been done. If you find one work by an author, you can quickly find their other works.

## Integrations

As a standalone system, an ORCID is not necessarily more valuable than any other scholarly identifier. Because it can both integrate and be integrated into other systems, an ORCID can serve as a key to access a scholarly presence controlled by the scholar. Additionally, librarians or other trusted parties can be added to profiles so that things like standardized affiliations can be curated. 
Many other systems which track publications have integrated ORCIDs. By connecting to some of the major publication tracking systems, scholars can minimize the time they spend on repetitive data entry, minimize errors, and validate their scholarly record. We will look at how to connect some of these systems in the next episode.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- The value of an ORCID goes up over the course of a scholar’s career
- Connecting an ORCID to other systems maximizes its benefit to scholarly online presence
- ORCID records help make research FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Inmteroperable, and Reusable)
