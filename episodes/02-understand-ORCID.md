:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- How can having an ORCID benefit scholars through practicing open science?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Describe author disambiguation and why it matters (makes your work Findable)
- List the range of scholarly outputs you can track (makes your work Accessible)
- Introduce systems where ORCID can be integrated (makes your record Interoperable)
- Understand how ORCID is institution agnostic (makes your record Reusable)

## ORCID's Place in Open Science Workflows

When an ORCID profile is populated and shared publicly, it becomes a powerful mechanism for structural change in scholarly communication. Benefits to scholars accumulate over the course of their careers, and what initially might look like one more account with the same information as their CV can actually free them from tedious, repetitive tasks. The more an ORCID is understood as a tool for making scholarly online presence robust and persistent, the more valuable it becomes to each scholar. Open science advances as the scholarly community collectively experiences these benefits. 

In this lesson we will look at the major benefits of maximizing an ORCID’s effectiveness, with the purpose of forming concepts to support advocacy and promotion within our institutional communities. 

## Author Disambiguation

As the number of scholars publishing work increases, the problem of telling authors apart from each other becomes more important to solve. When only internal or proprietary systems hold authoritative metadata that is verified by the authors, librarians, or other trusted parties, the value of their work is diminished. Especially as scholars move from institution to institution, and affiliations are listed in a variety of ways, records become harder to track. Databases which aggregate journals may not be able to accurately distinguish among many authors with the same name. Departments may not be able to track their publishing activity. Researchers working in adjacent areas may not find each other to collaborate. Recruiters may not be aware of the full scope of a researcher’s contribution to their field. A scholar may be asked to enter the same information about their published work over and over in different systems, detracting from their focus and taking away cognitive resources that could be assigned to high value tasks.

## RANDOM NAMES, REAL AUTHORS?

1. Use Namey to generate a random name:  https://namey.muffinlabs.com/ 
2. Enter this name into ORCID’s search box:  https://orcid.org/ 
3. Put quotes around the text so that it is read as a string
4. Hit enter. How many results did you get?

Try doing this with your own name, or the name of a colleague. Identical names can appear to be the same person, but ORCID gives researchers a persistent Unique Identifier (UID) that keeps them distinctive in any system that integrates it.

## QUESTIONS:

* How many variations of listing your institutional affiliation have you seen? 
* How many have you heard people use to refer to their place of employment, or their unit or department?
* Is there a standard way of listing affiliation at your institution?

## NAME CHANGES

What are some reasons an author might want to edit how their name appears in connection with their publications?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

## POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS
 
* Co-authors might submit your name in a way you do not prefer
* Your legal name may change over time
* Branding: a standard name standardizes your scholarly publishing online presence

## Figures

You can use standard markdown for static figures with the following syntax:

`![optional caption that appears below the figure](figure url){alt='alt text for
accessibility purposes'}`

![You belong in The Carpentries!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carpentries/logo/master/Badge_Carpentries.svg){alt='Blue Carpentries hex person logo with no text.'}

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

Callout sections can highlight information.

They are sometimes used to emphasise particularly important points
but are also used in some lessons to present "asides": 
content that is not central to the narrative of the lesson,
e.g. by providing the answer to a commonly-asked question.

## Math

One of our episodes contains $\LaTeX$ equations when describing how to create
dynamic reports with {knitr}, so we now use mathjax to describe this:

`$\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$` becomes: $\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$

Cool, right?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Use `.md` files for episodes when you want static content
- Use `.Rmd` files for episodes when you need to generate output
- Run `sandpaper::check_lesson()` to identify any issues with your lesson
- Run `sandpaper::build_lesson()` to preview your lesson locally
