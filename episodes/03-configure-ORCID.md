::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Explain the benefits of connecting ORCID to external systems for research visibility and impact tracking
- Configure the connection between ORCID and Crossref to automatically import publication metadata
- Set up the integration between ORCID and DataCite to include dataset and software citations
- Set up and use the integration between ORCID and Dimensions to import publication metadata and to claim publications and update the ORCID record to enrich profile data with additional scholarly content

## Automating Repetitive Tasks With ORCID

Managing research outputs effectively across different platforms can be challenging for researchers. While ORCID provides a persistent digital identifier for researchers, its full potential comes from its ability to integrate with other scholarly systems. This episode focuses on connecting your ORCID profile with three key systems: CrossRef, DataCite, and Dimensions.

CrossRef's auto-update feature automatically adds your published articles to your ORCID record, DataCite ensures your datasets and other research outputs are properly attributed, and Dimensions provides an additional way to manually add publications to your ORCID record through its 'Add to ORCID' feature. These integrations help create a comprehensive record of your research contributions.

By connecting ORCID with these systems, you can:

* Save time by reducing manual data entry
* Ensure accurate attribution of your work
* Increase the visibility of your research outputs
* Maintain up-to-date records across multiple platforms
* Track your research impact more effectively

Throughout this episode, you'll learn how to set up and manage these integrations, understand their features, and troubleshoot common issues. These integrations will help streamline your research workflow and enhance your digital presence in the scholarly ecosystem.

## Configuring ORCID Integrations

For each integration, write down the steps you would take to enable auto-update feature that automatically updated your ORCID records with new publications. If you have access to these accounts, you can perform the actual steps. These integrations will help you maintain an up-to-date record of your research outputs without manual intervention.

## Connecting ORCID to Crossref

1. Provide your ORCID iD when submitting a paper to a journal. Most publishing platforms allow to enter your ORCID iD in the submission system.
2. Once the paper gets published, the publisher will register it with Crossref and include your ORCID iD in the metadata
3. Check your ORCID inbox after you publish. You'll receive a notification in your ORCID inbox with the subject “Crossref has made changes to your ORCID record”
4. Authorize Crossref Auto-updates. Once you receive the notification, grant Crossref permission to update your record.
5. Optional. Manually link Crossref to ORCID

## Connecting ORCID to DataCite

Method 1: Through your ORCID record

1. Log in to your ORCID account
2. Navigate to your ORCID record
3. Find the "Works" section
4. Click on "Add"
5. Select "Search & Link"
6. Look for and select the DataCite option
7. Grant permissions to DataCite when prompted

Method 2: Through DataCite 

1. Go to DataCite Profiles (https://profiles.datacite.org/)
2. Sign in with Globus. Select Indiana University
3. Go to Settings. Click on your name to access menu

## Connecting ORCID to Dimensions

1. Go to the Dimensions platform (https://app.dimensions.ai).
2. Log in to your Dimensions account (or create one).
3. Look for an option to connect your ORCID. In your account settings click on “ORCID Information” link.
4. Click on the option to connect your ORCID.

## Figures

You can use standard markdown for static figures with the following syntax:

`![optional caption that appears below the figure](figure url){alt='alt text for
accessibility purposes'}`

![You belong in The Carpentries!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carpentries/logo/master/Badge_Carpentries.svg){alt='Blue Carpentries hex person logo with no text.'}

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

Callout sections can highlight information.

They are sometimes used to emphasise particularly important points
but are also used in some lessons to present "asides": 
content that is not central to the narrative of the lesson,
e.g. by providing the answer to a commonly-asked question.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


## Math

One of our episodes contains $\LaTeX$ equations when describing how to create
dynamic reports with {knitr}, so we now use mathjax to describe this:

`$\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$` becomes: $\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$

Cool, right?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Connecting ORCID to external systems automates the process of keeping your research profile up-to-date and comprehensive
- The Crossref integration ensures that journal articles and conference proceedings are accurately attributed to your ORCID profile without manual entry
- Linking ORCID with DataCite allows for proper credit and visibility of non-traditional research outputs like datasets and software
- The Dimensions connection provides access to enhanced your ORCID record by adding publications and grant information.
- These integrations support better author disambiguation and improve information accuracy across the research ecosystem
